Run Lidarr smaller, lightweight and more secure than ever

# INTRODUCTION üì¢

Lidarr is a music collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new tracks from your favorite artists and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.

# SYNOPSIS üìñ
**What can I do with this?** This image will give you a rootless and lightweight Lidarr installation.
# UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION üí∂
**Why should I run this image and not the other image(s) that already exist?** Good question! Because ...

> [!IMPORTANT]
>* ... this image runs [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) as 1000:1000
>* ... this image is auto updated to the latest version via CI/CD
>* ... this image has a health check
>* ... this image runs read-only
>* ... this image is automatically scanned for CVEs before and after publishing
>* ... this image is created via a secure and pinned CI/CD process
>* ... this image is very small

If you value security, simplicity and optimizations to the extreme, then this image might be for you.

# COMPARISON üèÅ
Below you find a comparison between this image and the most used or original one.

| **image** | **size on disk** | **init default as** | **[distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md)** | supported architectures
| ---: | ---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 11notes/lidarr:2.13.3 | 175MB | 1000:1000 | ‚ùå | amd64, arm64, armv7 |
| linuxserver/lidarr | 287MB | 0:0 | ‚ùå | amd64, arm64 |

**Why is this image not distroless?** I would have loved to create a distroless, single binary image, sadly the way that Lidarr is setup makes it really difficult to compile a static binary from source. Enabling AOT breaks almost 30% of used libraries because they are not setup to be statically linked (like Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location). It‚Äôs also not fixable with a single PR. This is something the Lidarr team would need to do.

# MAIN TAGS üè∑Ô∏è
These are the main tags for the image. There is also a tag for each commit and its shorthand sha256 value.

* [2.13.3](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/lidarr/tags?name=2.13.3)
* [2.13.3-unraid](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/lidarr/tags?name=2.13.3-unraid)

### There is no latest tag, what am I supposed to do about updates?
It is of my opinion that the ```:latest``` tag is dangerous. Many times, I‚Äôve introduced **breaking** changes to my images. This would have messed up everything for some people. If you don‚Äôt want to change the tag to the latest [semver](https://semver.org/), simply use the short versions of [semver](https://semver.org/). Instead of using ```:2.13.3``` you can use ```:2``` or ```:2.13```. Since on each new version these tags are updated to the latest version of the software, using them is identical to using ```:latest``` but at least fixed to a major or minor version.

If you still insist on having the bleeding edge release of this app, simply use the ```:rolling``` tag, but be warned! You will get the latest version of the app instantly, regardless of breaking changes or security issues or what so ever. You do this at your own risk!

# REGISTRIES ‚òÅÔ∏è
```
docker pull 11notes/lidarr:2.13.3
docker pull ghcr.io/11notes/lidarr:2.13.3
docker pull quay.io/11notes/lidarr:2.13.3
```

# UNRAID VERSION üü†
This image supports unraid by default. Simply add **-unraid** to any tag and the image will run as 99:100 instead of 1000:1000 causing no issues on unraid. Enjoy.
